## Overview 
- Our goal is to provide a simple way for users to track their intake of varying substances
- We prioritized an easy to use application that neither shames users for their intake, nor ecourages their intake
- We used React Native as the framework of our application in order to run it on ios devices\
- Our backend is built from firebase with a simple tree that 

## Installation
- To install the app, follow these commands
```
TODO: installation cmds, need to figure out this method
```

## Running the program
- To run the program, follow these commands
```
TODO: running commands, windows=expo go + qr code
```

## Using the application
- The user will first be presented with an authentification screen 
- TODO: steps on what to do at this screen

- At the bottom off the screen there will be a bar to switch betweent the 4 main pages
    - Log
        - This page allows users to log the substances they took and send it to the database
        - There are total 18 substances for the user to choose from
        - Users can log more than one substance taken in a singlee log instance
    - Analysis
        - TODO: explain the purpose of this page
    - Calendar
        - The calendar page allows users to check the total substance logs for any given day
        - Upon the user selecting a day from the calendar component, the box at the bottom of the screen will display the sum of each substance taken that day
        - If there were no logs on that day, or if the day is in the future, the log display box will say "no logs for the selected day"
    - Search
        - The search page allows users to find more information about the substances 
        - This includes other names or brands, for example antidepressants include Lexapro and Prozac, or LSD is also called acid
        - Each substance also has a link for additional safety information via a link to the National Institute on Drug Abuse website, which lists possible health effects and treatment options
